# dike/vm

The virtual machine that executes dike vm instructions.

TODO:

- Figure out how to write to variables in another sweep
- Make number all one value and do all that dirty work isolated
- Try using string slices instead of strings
- Find a more efficient way to create an instruction graph
- Find out a way to run commands 1 at a time (repl-like behavior)
- TESTS!!!
